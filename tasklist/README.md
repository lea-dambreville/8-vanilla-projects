## Vanilla Project 1

This is a mini adaptation project.

I took John Smilga's (a.k.a coding addict) grocery-bud tutorial project and added the changeBackgroundColor() functionality to it, as well as slightly changing the CSS to give the project a new look.

The changeBackgroundColor() function changes the background color of the app according to the number of task that is on the list. The background goes from green to red as the number of tasks in the list go from 1 to 6+.

For the CSS I changed the font, added new color variables and deleted some properties.

I also changed the class names throughout the files as was appropriate for the adaption of the project. Most of the change in class names was changing from "grocery" to "task" or "tasklist"

I added comments in both the app.js and the style.css to point out where I added code or made changes.
